## This is "Das Beste(-)Spiel".

A highly realistic simulation of the everyday duties of a boss overseeing several offices.
The goal is, at the end of the day, to generate money. At the very least not lose all of it.
The employees help in this regard, but only as long as they are productive!

## How to play

To start the simulation, first press enter. Instructions in German appear, press space to proceed.
From then on, you play with the mouse. Therefore, checking emails whilst playing is easily done.
The rules are simple: Stay in your office as long as enough employees are productive. Closely observe the money counter on the top left - if numbers are falling, you should act! Click on the doors of your employees that cost too much but find it more interesting to talk about their day or take a nap rather than work! But be careful - as soon as you leave your office to go on patrol, you stop making money.
The realism of this simulation can only go so far - rather than the 18 hours of the typical workday, a day in this simulation is only 3 1/2 minutes.

## Usages of this simulation

I firmly believe that every boss of an institution or company can greatly profit from practicing this game daily. Studies are underway. I provide this service for free, but if you are a successful CEO please consider donating some money.
